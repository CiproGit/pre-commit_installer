# pre-commit_installer
Requirements:
* Git must be installed in C:\Program Files
* pre-commit package manager must be installed.

This program takes the project directory as input, automatically searches for all the subdirectories containing the .pre-commit-config.yaml configuration files and executes `pre-commit install` command there.  
The filepath can be written with either slash or backslash.  
Documentation about pre-commit can be found on https://pre-commit.com/
